Decision Tree From Scratch
-> Understanding decision trees algorithm, the concept of false branch and True branch where each node has following properties:

  -> Id ; where parent node has id n , the false branch child has id 2n+1 and the true branch child has id 2n+2.
  
    -> A decision node will have question 
    
    -> A leaf node will have max class label counts or prediction class
 -> depth - depth of the tree
    
-> Sklearn Lab

    -> Using Neural net to solve the XOR gate problem
  
    -> Creating a neural net to solve a classification problem using Wine dataset from sklearn to understand the machine learning project           lifecyle
